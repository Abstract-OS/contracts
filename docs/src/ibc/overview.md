# Interchain Abstract Accounts

Interchain Abstract Accounts is Abstract's solution to chain-agnostic accounts. It allows users to create an account on one chain and use it on any other chain that supports Abstract. This is achieved by using a combination of the [Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol](https://ibcprotocol.org/) and the [Abstract Accounts](../introduction/architecture.md).
