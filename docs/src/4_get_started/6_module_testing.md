# Testing Your Module

Testing your smart-contracts is a crucial step in its development. Without proper testing you risk compromising the accounts of your users and with it the funds that they hold. For that reason we expect modules to be thoroughly tested before they are allowed on our platform.

This section of the documentation outlines the different testing methods. Each method is accompanied with an Abstract helper. These helpers assist you in setting up your testing environment.

## Unit-testing

The lowest level of testing is *unit testing*. Unit-tests allow you to easily test complex, self-contained logic. Because unit-tests should be self-contained, any queries made to other contracts need to be mocked. These mocks acts as "query catchers", allowing you to specify a response for a specific query.

Sadly constructing these mock queries is time consuming and involves a lot of boiler-plate. Additionally there are queries that your module should always support as they are part of its base implementation. For those reasons we created an `abstract-testing` package.

The `abstract-testing` provides you with some small abstractions that allow you to mock Smart and Raw queries.

```admonish info
What's the difference between a Smart and a Raw query?

- **Smart Queries:** A smart-query is a query that contains a message in its request. It commonly involves computation on the queried contract. After this optional computation and state-loading the contract responds with a *ResponseMsg*. Mocking this type of query involves matching the serialized query request message (`Binary`) to a specific message type and returning a serialized response. Any expected computation needs to be mocked as well.

- **Raw Queries:** A raw-query is a simple database key-value lookup. To mock this type of query you need to provide a mapping of the raw key to a raw value. The returned value then needs to be interpreted correctly according to the store's type definitions.

### Mock Querier

The `abstract-testing` package contains a [`MockQuerierBuilder`](). It uses the common **builder pattern** to allow for efficient mock construction. Let's see how!

#### Mocking Smart Queries

Mocking a smart-query with the [`MockQuerierBuilder`]() is easy! You do it by calling the `with_smart_handler` function.

**Example**

```rust
{{#include ../../../packages/abstract-testing/src/mock_querier.rs:smart_query}}
```

#### Mocking Raw Queries

Instead of manually mapping the key-value relation and it's types, we can use the available contract storage types. Using the storage types ensures that the mock and its data operations are the same as in the actual implementation. It also saves us a lot of work related to key serialization.

This approach allow you to easily map `Item` and `Map` datastores.

```admonish warning
Multi-index maps are currently not supported. PRs on this issue are welcome! ðŸ¤—

**Example**

#### Abstract Querier

The easiest and best way to start using the querier is to use the `AbstractMockQuerierBuilder::mocked_account_querier_builder()` method. This method sets up a mock querier with an initial abstract account.

## Integration Testing

Integration testing your contract involves deploying your contract and any of its dependencies to a mock environment. Abstract uses cw-orchestrator's `Mock` struct that is backed by a `cw-multi-test::App` which you might be familiar with.

```admonish info
`cw-orchestrator` is a CosmWasm scripting tool that we developed to improve the speed at which developers can test and deploy their applications. We recommend reading the [cw-orchestrator documentation]() if you are not yet familiar with it.
```

TODO: talk about the mock and show a test-setup with it.

## Local Daemon Testing

 Once you have confirmed that your module works as expected you can spin up a local node and deploy Abstract + your app onto the chain. You can do this by running the [test-local]() example, which uses a locally running juno daemon to deploy to. At this point you can also test your front-end with the contracts.

```admonish warn
Locally testing your Abstract deployment is difficult if it depends on other protocols, and those protocols don't make use of [cw-orchestrator]().
```
