# Account Creation

We know you're really excited to start playing with your module but there's one more thing you need to do first. Abstract cares about your efforts and we believe you should have the ability to monetize your modules in any way that you see fit. To help us provide that feature we created the concept of **module namespaces**. A module namespace is your (or your team's) publishing domain for Abstract modules. Through this design you can monetize your product through a namespace or per-modules basis as explained in more detail in the [monetization]() section.

Each namespace must be associated with an Abstract account, hence you will need to create one.

## Creating an Account

Creating an account is straight forward process. Go to the [Abstract Account Portal]() and click "Create Account". Come back here once you have your account set up.

## Claim a Namespace

Now that you have your account you can proceed to claim your namespace. The namespace will be exclusively linked to your Abstract Account and will prefix your module names to form a unique module identifier.

> For example, if your namespace is `myapp` and your module name is `mymodule` then your module identifier will be `myapp:mymodule`.

You can easily claim your namespace by going to your Account on our website and click the "Claim Namespace" button on the account page. You will be asked to pay a small fee to claim your namespace. This fee is used to prevent namespace squatting and to help us maintain the Abstract ecosystem.

With the setup out of the way let's get to the fun part: building your module!
