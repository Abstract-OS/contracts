# Abstract SDK - How to get started

This tutorial will walk you through the process of setting up your development environment, creating an [app module](../3_framework/7_module_types.md#apps), and deploying your first app to our on-chain store with [cw-orchestator](https://github.com/AbstractSDK/cw-orchestrator).

If you want to learn more about Abstract before writing code you can check out the [*About Abstract*](../3_framework/1_abstract_sdk.md) section of our documentation.

## Prerequisites

1. A minimal understanding of Rust is expected. If you are new to Rust, you can find a great introduction to the language in the [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

2. The Abstract SDK is built using the CosmWasm smart-contract framework. If you are new to CosmWasm, you can find a great introduction to the framework in the [CosmWasm Book](https://book.cosmwasm.com/).

3. Abstract also makes extensive use of [`cw-orchestrator`](https://github.com/AbstractSDK/cw-orchestrator), our CosmWasm scripting library. You can read its documentation [here](https://orchestrator.abstract.money/).
