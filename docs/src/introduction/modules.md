# Abstract Modules

Abstract's innovative framework is built on the concept of modules, which are reusable components that can be easily integrated into your decentralized applications (dApps). Modules streamline the development process by providing pre-built functionalities, saving you time and effort. With Abstract, you can choose from a curated library of off-the-shelf modules or create your own custom modules using the Abstract SDK. Developers can further monetize their own custom modules to allow for sustainable development.

## Available Modules

The Abstract ecosystem offers a wide range of off-the-shelf modules to cater to various use cases and requirements. Some of the available modules include:

Note: This is not an exhaustive list. The Abstract ecosystem is constantly evolving, and new modules are regularly added to the library.

## How to Use Modules in Your Project
Leveraging modules in your project can significantly simplify the development process, allowing you to deploy projects faster and more cost-effectively than building traditionally. By using pre-built, tested, and community-reviewed modules, you can focus on your project's unique features while reducing development time and minimizing potential bugs.

Here's an example of how modules can be leveraged for a decentralized finance (DeFi) project:

Imagine you want to create a DeFi application with the following features:

- A fungible token for your platform
- Staking and delegation functionality
- A governance system for community-driven decision-making
- Integration with an oracle for fetching off-chain data

Instead of building each feature from scratch, you can leverage Abstract's off-the-shelf modules to implement these functionalities with ease. This not only saves time and resources but also ensures that your project benefits from the best practices established by the Abstract community.

**Step 1:** Choose the relevant modules from the Abstract library, such as:
Token Module for fungible tokens
Staking Module for staking and delegation
Governance Module for creating a governance system
Oracle Module for integrating with an oracle service

**Step 2:** Import the chosen modules into your project and configure them according to your requirements. This can include setting custom parameters, such as token supply, staking rewards, or voting thresholds.

**Step 3:** Integrate the modules with your existing codebase, ensuring they work seamlessly with your project's unique features. This can involve calling module functions, implementing hooks, or extending your data structures.

**Step 4:** Test your dApp thoroughly to ensure the modules function as intended and do not introduce any unexpected behavior.

By leveraging Abstract's modules in this way, you can rapidly build and deploy your DeFi project while benefiting from the robustness and flexibility of the Abstract ecosystem.
