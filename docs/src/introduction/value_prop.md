# Abstract: Redefining Value in Open-Source Development

Abstract is a groundbreaking platform that's reshaping the landscape for developers, users, and project builders alike.

The world we live in today with all of the creature comforts and conveniences we have was built on the shoulders of giants that put in unfathomable hours to create critical infrastructure that is leveraged every day, with no credit and no incentivization structure. This has created a stagnant innovation market which Abstract seeks to revitalize through strong financial incentives and innate collaborative systems that encourage developers to push boundaries and move the blockchain space forward. By leveraging a novel economic model, Abstract allows developers to be continually rewarded for their contributions, creating a sustainable income stream tied to the actual usage of their work.

## Real-World Use Cases

### For Developers

Imagine a world where a developer creates a critical module used by thousands of companies worldwide, and instead of a one-time payment, they earn from every use. 

Abstract was envisioned to be a project that creates a fair and equitable future for Open Source developers, but the additional benefit that this offers is for developers who work for companies and projects that are looking to leverage modules in a safe and secure manner. Abstract Modules are all audited and vetted by trusted auditors, can be picked up off the shelf and plugged in for simple implementation to create robust, feature-rich products in a fraction of the time. What used to take months of work can now be shared and paid for equitably by all parties involved with the development of a new product or service.

### For Project Builders

Consider a project builder that can stake tokens to fund the development of a new tool they need, directly incentivizing and guiding its creation. The current system is slow and encumbered by a myriad of issues; capital constraints, sourcing talent, identifying product-market-fit, practicality of cost-benefit, and much, much more. Project Builders can now survey the landscape of available Modules, plan and develop their product, and fund the development of any of the missing features so that future Project Builders can leverage them for their own use.

Creating an innately collaborative system for development that allows for the best ideas to take root and earn in perpetuity is essential to scaling blockchain projects to eat the world and run the global financial system effectively and efficiently. 

These are not distant dreams, but real-world applications of Abstract's transformative approach to open-source software development.
