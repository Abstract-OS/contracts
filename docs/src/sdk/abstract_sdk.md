# Abstract SDK - Overview

The Abstract SDK is at the core of Abstract's platform. It's a modular smart-contract framework designed to simplify the development of CosmWasm dApps.

## What Problem Does it Solve?

The Abstract SDK is designed to solve the following problems:

- **Reusability:** CosmWasm development has been a start-from-scratch process up until now. The Abstract SDK allows developers to reuse components across multiple dApps, reducing development time, increasing productivity, iteration speed and shortening the go-to-market of your ideas.
- **Security:** The Abstract SDK is built on top of the CosmWasm smart-contract framework, which is a battle-tested and highly secure platform. Because of its modular design, it's also easier to audit and test. Audited components can be reused across multiple dApps, reducing the risk of bugs and vulnerabilities.
- **Complexity:** The Abstract SDK simplifies the development process by providing a modular framework that allows developers to focus on the core functionality of their dApp.
- **Compatibility:** The Abstract SDK is designed to work seamlessly with popular on-chain services in the Cosmos ecosystem, decentralized exchanges, money markets, oracles, etc.
- **Interoperability:** The Abstract SDK is chain-agnostic, allowing developers to build dApps that can interact with multiple blockchains within the Cosmos ecosystem.
- **Scalability:** The Abstract SDK is designed to scale with the needs of the developer, allowing them to easily deploy to new networks, iterate on their product and achieve product market fit. Through its novel on-chain application store it also allows for personalized dApps that can be customized by the user to meet their specific needs, making the Abstract SDK the first decentralized software distribution platform.
- **Collaboration:** The Abstract SDK enables developers to collaborate on the creation of dApps its composable architecture and the ability to easily publish testing infrastructure for mock environment construction.
