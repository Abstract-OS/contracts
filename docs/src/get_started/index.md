# Abstract SDK - How to get started

So you want to build on Abstract? Let's get your idea shipped!

This tutorial will walk you through the process of setting up your development environment, creating an [app module](./module_development.md), and deploying your first module to our on-chain store with [cw-orchestator](https://github.com/AbstractSDK/cw-orchestrator).

## Prerequisites

1. A minimal understanding of Rust is expected. If you are new to Rust, you can find a great introduction to the language in the [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

2. The Abstract SDK is built using the CosmWasm smart-contract framework. If you are new to CosmWasm, you can find a great introduction to the framework in the [CosmWasm Book](https://book.cosmwasm.com/).

3. Abstract also makes extensive use of [`cw-orchestrator`](https://github.com/AbstractSDK/cw-orchestrator), our CosmWasm scripting library. You can read its documentation [here](https://orchestrator.abstract.money/).
