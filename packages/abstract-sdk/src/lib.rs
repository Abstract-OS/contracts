//! ### Abstract Base
//!
//! To use an API either construct a [`feature object`](crate::feature_objects) or use an Abstract base contract as the starting-point of your application.  
//! The available base contracts are:
//!
//! |  Kind          | Migratable | Installable  |
//! |----------------|---------------|---------------|
//! | [App](https://crates.io/crates/abstract-app) | ✅  | ✅ |
//! | [API](https://crates.io/crates/abstract-api)   | ❌ | ✅ |
//! | [IBC-host](https://crates.io/crates/abstract-ibc-host)   | ✅ | ❌ |
//!
//! Each base supports a set of endpoints that can accept custom handlers. These handlers can be added to the base using a static builder pattern.
//! All the available endpoints are discussed [here](crate::base::endpoints).
//!
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Add `abstract-sdk` to your `Cargo.toml` by running:
//! ```bash
//! $ cargo add abstract-sdk
//! ```

    //! You can easily create and provide your own API for other smart-contract developers by using these features as trait bounds.
